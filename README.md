# FoodCal

FoodCal is your personal nutrition companion that makes calorie tracking beautiful and effortless.

"Tracking calories shouldn't feel like doing taxes" - Our Design Philosophy

## How does it work?

If you want to:

**Track Your Journey** - Open the calendar view and start logging your meals. Each day shows your progress with beautiful visual indicators, and you can quickly add food entries or view your logs with just a tap.

**See The Big Picture** - Check out the yearly overview that shows your nutrition patterns in a GitHub-style contribution graph. Watch as your daily entries paint a picture of your journey through different shades of green.

**Stay Organized** - Categorize your meals, track your daily calories, and manage your food logs all in one place. The interface adapts to your needs, whether you're planning ahead or reviewing past entries.
